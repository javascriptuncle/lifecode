// code song

Once I wake-up alive
I rub both of my eyes
then I stand from my bed
with rolling over head

I brush up all my teeth
kill all the germs beneeth
then wash up of my face
get ready for the race

I will have some breakfast
that fill me over last
then I book a ola car
as my office is so for 

I start my work engine
with pasword put-ting in
n-with tickets full-of load
i open vs code

I break-up all my task
with TL, who I ask
WE brainston from 9 to 10
with notebook and a pen

me code-full of my mind
I do code for long time
with having lot of fun
I makesure work is done

When time comes for testing
I finish up pasting
then tester gives some try
our brrain goes over fry

we debug the buggy bug
that never gave me hug
with methods lots to try
we feel like fry to cry

by the-time we get realise
that bug was not my size
it ate up whole my day
with mouth noword to say

One comma that-I forgot
that pain me fucking lot
and with changing, testing, submit
I finally code commit 

My codes when gets Deploy 
with team, full of  joy
I test, its working-up
with smile and tea-full-cup

I close-up all my thought
whom so ever i fought.
with sense of learnng mode
i close my vs-code

Thats all for all my day
with mistakes i will play
as a part of learning life
may you all blossom n thrive

Thank you
